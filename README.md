🔓 Crypto-Drainers — Open-Source Reference Codes

Venom Drainer Suite

Educational Blockchain Development Framework

Overview
The Venom Drainer Suite is an open-source, educational framework designed for developers, researchers, and students who wish to study advanced smart contract patterns, wallet interactions, and multi-chain integration techniques. The suite provides real-world code examples and reference implementations that demonstrate how different token standards and cross-chain designs operate in practice.

⚡ Key Capabilities & Components

Open-Source Codebases

Solidity smart contracts (Ethereum & EVM chains: BSC, Polygon, Base, etc.)

Rust programs (Solana)

Integration scripts and examples for Tron, TON, and other non-EVM chains

Frontend templates demonstrating secure wallet integration and dApp UX


Multi-Chain Architecture
Reference designs that illustrate interoperability strategies across EVM chains and non-EVM ecosystems (Solana, Tron, TON).

Transaction & Performance Concepts
High-level examples for studying: gas optimization approaches, transaction batching concepts, and robust error handling patterns.

Supported Asset Types

ERC-20 (fungible tokens)

ERC-721 & ERC-1155 (NFTs and semi-fungible tokens)

Native chain assets (ETH, BNB, SOL, TRX, TON, etc.)


Documentation & Learning Guides
Step-by-step documentation to inspect, run, and extend the code in safe, test-network environments.

🛠 Types of Reference Implementations (Educational)

> The following categories are presented for academic analysis and secure testing only.



1. NFT Reference Modules

Demonstrate ERC-721 and ERC-1155 transfer, approval, and metadata handling patterns.



2. Token Reference Modules (ERC-20)

Illustrate allowance/approval flows, safe transfer patterns, and token swap interaction models.



3. Multi-Chain Reference Modules

Show architectural considerations for bridging logic, message formats, and cross-chain adapters.



4. Native Asset Reference Modules

Present raw transaction construction, signing, and submission patterns for native coins on target chains.



5. Hybrid Modules

Combine token and NFT handling to show multi-asset contract interfaces and workflow orchestration.



6. Frontend-Integrated DApp Examples

Full-stack examples combining UI with contract interactions to study wallet connection flows, user prompts, and basic anti-phishing UX patterns.




Note: Solana, Tron and TON toolchains and examples are included for study of non-EVM architectures and signing models.


---

🌍 Chains Covered (Representative)

EVM-compatible: Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, Fantom, Cronos, and others.

Non-EVM: Solana, Tron, The Open Network (TON), and limited modules for Aptos.

📚 Educational Use Cases

Developers: Test and inspect smart contract design patterns in controlled environments (local/testnets).

Students & Researchers: Analyze transaction flows, token standards, and cross-chain interaction models.

Instructors: Use vetted source code as teaching aids and for secure lab assignments.
