🔓 Crypto-Drainers Open Source Codes

Venom Drainer Suite: Educational Blockchain Development Framework

An Open-Source Resource for Studying Smart Contracts and Blockchain Integration


---

⚡ Purpose of the Venom Drainer Suite

The Venom Drainer Suite is an educational, open-source framework built for developers, researchers, and blockchain students who want to understand how advanced smart contracts, wallet interactions, and multi-chain integrations are designed.

This framework includes real-world code examples supporting:

20+ blockchain networks

450+ wallets

Various token standards like NFTs (ERC721, ERC1155), fungible tokens (ERC20), and native assets

🛠 Types of Drainers (Educational Reference)

When studying open-source code, you’ll come across different “drainer” structures — each focusing on a specific use case. These are common categories for educational analysis:

1. NFT Drainers

Built for NFT standards (ERC721 & ERC1155)

Used to study how transfers, approvals, and listings work



2. Token Drainers (ERC20)

Deals with fungible tokens on EVM chains

Demonstrates token allowances, approvals, and swaps



3. Multi-Chain Drainers

Designed to run across several blockchains (EVM + Solana + Tron + TON)

Useful for studying compatibility layers



4. Native Coin Drainers

Focus on ETH, BNB, MATIC, SOL, TRX, TON

Demonstrates low-level transaction building and signing



5. Hybrid Drainers

Handle both NFTs & tokens

Show how universal contracts interact with mixed assets



6. Frontend-Integrated Drainers

Combine UI + contracts

Help students learn wallet connections, phishing protection, and dApp security testing
